  there is an issue on line 184 and 185 where they flatten() the output of the self.actor (target?) network
  and asserts for the shape of the user defined action_space.
  IF action_space is not 1 dimensional, this always throws an assert error.

  this was fixed by making the user defined action_space 1 dimensional and reshaping in the environment for use
